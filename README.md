# WeatherApp
A basic weather checking application that tells you the weather based on the city inputed. Built using Vanilla JS. 
I made this application to get used to working with APIs, and to make something semi-useful as with this application it is really easy to check the weather/temperature since all you have to do is input the name of the city you want to check.

* dotenv: 10.0.0
